some notes one building my first twitter bot...

## *What I am looking at to begin building a bot*
* [*Cheap Bots, Done Quick!*](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/)
  
  This is a Twitter app which automatically Tweets based on a Tracery Grammar. This is a good start for begining how to use a *context free grammar*, but how can aI make my own posting interface, which pulls on an api and also responds to incoming text? The interface on *Cheap Bots, Done Quick!* appears to only take a JSON formated source file.
